# Documentation Updates Required After Normalization Fix

## Summary of Changes

The normalization fix dramatically improved MERaLiON results. **MERaLiON now BEATS Whisper!**

### Key Metric Changes:

**NSC Part 1 (682 utterances):**
- MERaLiON-2-10B: 26.1% ‚Üí **13.6% WER** (12.5pp improvement!)
- MERaLiON-2-3B:  29.0% ‚Üí **13.1% WER** (15.9pp improvement!)
- Whisper-small: 17.9% WER (unchanged)

**Result:** MERaLiON-2-10B now outperforms Whisper by 4.3pp!

**Self-Curated Conversational (20 samples):**
- MERaLiON-2-10B: 39.8% ‚Üí **66.5% WER**
- MERaLiON-2-3B:  23.8% ‚Üí **38.8% WER**  
- Whisper-small: 38.0% ‚Üí **52.2% WER**
