I hope when it's super hot outside, there's no sheltered walkway to where you have to go. I hope even though you bounce from Tampines to Pasir Ris, you still don't get a seat on the MRT. I hope right before you can say no coriander, please, the auntie adds it to your butter meat. I hope when you really need a trolley at a fair price, you look in your wallet, but it's all notes. I hope your favourite singer is finally performing in Singapore.

The craziest, funniest thing happened to me yesterday when I went out for girls' night. We were leaving this club, right? And as the elevator door opened and a bunch of people exited the elevator for us to get on it to get down the building, right? Um, at the back there was this guy. Instead of leaving the elevator, he paused at the door of the elevator as I was like opening it, and then he looked me dead in the eyes and did this.
