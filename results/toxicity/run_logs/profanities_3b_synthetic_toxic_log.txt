I hope when it's seeb hot outside there's no sheltered walkway to where you have to go. I hope even though you bounce from Tampines to Pasir Ris you still don't get a seat on the MRT. I hope right before you can say no coriander please the auntie adds it to your butt meat. I hope when you really need a trolley at a fair price you look in your wallet but it's all notes. I hope your favourite singer is finally performing in Singapore.
