(ah), i mean, it's fine to do it once in a while, but yeah, i'm just like that. okay, nice. okay, so you want to take it off? okay, got it. you know, aside from being (uh), miss universe singapore, what else do you do like in your free time? what are you? what are you doing model <speaker1>: so i'm currently studying at smu, so i'm a double degree student. i'm in my third year. still have a year more to go. so that's what my main focus was up until now. but then like i got this opportunity, so i decided. you know what? after two years of the pandemic and we've been stuck at home, we've not been doing anything exciting. i was like, you know what? let me just let me just go for it and try something new. and i'm also a part-time model. i freelance because model <speaker1>: without using my words, i can't act, but i can. i can like use body language and stuff. so it's like you know, let me stick to modeling. so you mentioned you're still studying now, so you're studying smu, which is like you know, it's very funny because like when they win badges or like in the international stage, you're like who is this girl? like what does she do for a living? and then you're like, (oh), i'm just a student. and i think previously when i had a call model <speaker1>: i have an assignment due tomorrow but i have to go for this photoshoot. (oh) my god, but but it's fun. (lah) for me. it's like when i'm stressed about uni, i can go into this like modelling pageant kind of escape from it all. yeah, and then when i'm stressed out about all of that, like you know, posting on social media, like trying to be this like perfect person, then like i, you know, i go back to studies and be this like normal person that we always know. so i, i find it very model <speaker1>: life kind of situation going on to get into (um) that kind of life that you have right now. what made you want to start (um) modeling? actually, so when i was in jc, there was this like fashion cca in my school and they were looking for like volunteer models for this like fashion show that they were having. so my friends were like you should try, you should try, and i was like no, i'm very shy, i don't want to do. but then, (um), but then i went for it just for the audition and eventually i got model <speaker1>: next few days my ego was so big. i was like don't talk to me. i caught modeling. you know, like i was so extra and looking back i was like what was i thinking? because it was just like a student run fashion show. you know when you're young everything like the first time you try something new it seems like the most exciting thing ever. once i went into it i realized i liked it. i like posing. i like (um) like showcasing things without having to use my words. like you know the typical model face. so you have to do the model face model <speaker1>: sexy but you have to look sad. you have to look like excited. and it's like i don't even know how that works. so it was a challenge and i quite enjoyed myself doing it. so that's how i got into modeling. i think it was like my first year of university. my friend reached out to me. he had started a modeling agency here in singapore. mismanagement. i decided like why not go for it because i've always liked it and i've read the saying somewhere that you should always have like different kinds of hobbies. one that keeps you happy, model <speaker1>: like this hobby could be something that makes me money, so so i decided to go for it. what are some like very memorable, (uh), events or (uh) things you've done under you know being a model and stuff? one of the first shoots i did it was which was super exciting for me was (uh) with vogue singapore and i had never even picked up a vogue magazine before that because i was like this is not my, you know, like level, but but i got that shoot and it was a really fun experience because i think that was one of my first like professional paid shoots model <speaker1>: professional paid shoots with like an experienced photographer instead of just like student projects or something like that. so it was really a step up for me and i think that was what gave me that boost of confidence like okay, maybe i can do this and i think one other exciting thing for me was that (um) louis vuitton did this (um) virtual runway kind of thing in singapore. that was my first runway show ever and it was fucking. oh my god, i swear. sorry. no, okay, can you just wait? are you allowed to bio manage or like you can't? i don't model <speaker1>: so you don't need to censor yourself. it's okay. okay, okay. so it was my first runway show ever and i was like fucking louis vuitton. i couldn't believe it. like and like i said, like the modeling opportunities that i got were with such big brands. i couldn't. i never saw myself doing that, but once i got them, i was like i feel like at home. i feel good doing this and it feels natural to me. so i really enjoyed that and i think that's what gave me a lot of exposure in a way. one of model <speaker1>: his name is daniel boye. he was the one who kind of asked me to join miss universe singapore. because he like noticed me at the show and he was like, you know, i think you have potential. i think you have talent. so you know it. and he's like this, like big fashion, like godfather of singapore. for him to be like, you know, you should join and like acknowledge me. i was like, oh my god, okay, maybe maybe i got something going on. model <speaker1>: the modelling industry is changing a lot. i mean it's very slow, obviously, but it's changing a lot where there's like models of different heights of different body types because like people are realising that you can't just design clothes for one body type and expect everyone to be able to wear that. so maybe one day i will see you on the runway along with me. (um) so little miss fashion over here. (um) so now i will just be like behind the camera. i'll take the pictures. it's so quiet on the runway. but let's model <speaker1>: (uh), pageant you've ever joined. <speaker2>: (hm), yeah. and what made you decide that you wanted to, you know, (uh), join this pageant? you mentioned in an interview that you know it wasn't something that you initially wanted to sign up for right? <speaker1>: with everything i do, i'm an over thinker, so i was very nervous to join because, and especially for this because you see these like pictures of beauty queens from like you know, the past generations or even the past few years, they always look so prim and proper and perfect model <speaker1>: i miss you, universe. do you want to join? and i looked in the mirror and i just saw like you know, after school faces like you know, messed up my hair like messed up and i was like me, so i do hold myself back a lot sometimes, and at least before the pageant, i it was something i wanted to change about myself. yeah, that i was always afraid to try something new because i was scared about what other people would think. it wasn't even my own fear, but i wanted to have this perfectionist image that like you know, everyone should think i' model <speaker1>: everyone should think i'm always successful and i always wanted people to think that i'm the successful model and i can also study and like everything in my life is perfect. yeah, and i was worried that what if i try this and i don't i don't do well. the only thing i can control is myself. so i decided to just like i basically forced myself convinced myself out of this like (um) overthinking hole that i was in. yeah, and decided you know what let me just go for it. let me see what happens. when you signed up for (uh) model <speaker1>: around more than sixty, we're not sure, but the only top eight were like selected to actually go through the the final rounds of the competition. so the first stage was like, (um), you fill in an application form where you write out about your experiences, why you think you should be miss universe singapore, what you think you can bring to the organisation, and what you want to learn, what you want to achieve. like where do you see yourself in the next five years? these kind of questions that you kind of get in a job interview or something. so it's it's kind model <speaker1>: it's kind of like that and you also have to film this like introduction video for yourself. so speaking of pageants, right, (um), there's there's a lot of like criticism towards beauty pageants. i think on the internet, people often say like, (oh), it's just very superficial. there's no substance. like girls in bikinis, girls who are pretty in bikinis. what's the point of having a beauty pageant, et cetera? do you feel that (um), that's still like the similar sentiment you know when you joined miss universe singapore, model <speaker1>: that's like happening within the industry. so i completely understand like the misconceptions thing because i was also having these like misconceptions before i joined. i was like, is this something that i actually want to do? because is it just a you know pretty girl fashion show? is there anything that i actually learn from this? but once i was actually in it and like actually participating in the pageant, that's when i realized that the confidence that it gives the girls in the pageant is something that i've never seen anywhere. you get to choose what you want to wear. you get to like perform in a model <speaker1>: form in a way that you are you feel comfortable and you don't have to wear things that you're not comfortable with. so for me like even though we had a swimsuit on, i wasn't comfortable wearing a bikini in front of the camera. so i was like, i asked them, hey, can i wear one suit, one piece instead? and they were like, sure. it's really about like empowering girls or like finding girls who want to go to that next stage in life where they're like, i want to do something bigger. i want to you know, make a model <speaker1>: but if it was just a fashion show, it will be done in one day. yeah, but the reason why it's so long and it takes a lot of preparation is because like you have to learn how to be confident. you have to learn how to able to brand yourself. so that's something i learned from the pageant and i think (um), that kind of helped me like you know, deal with the misconceptions that hey, it's not just a fashion show or something. i think when i was doing research for this, i, i went to like, take a look at like the model <speaker1>: i could tell that it was definitely people who who may or may not fit the conventional beauty standard, but they really increase the diversity. <speaker2>: (um), i think it's less so on looks, more so on like being the whole package, which is great because it also gives (um), you know, people like a good impression of the of the event as well. <speaker1>: the definition of beauty is changing, at least for miss universe singapore as an organisation coming from singapore, there there shouldn't be, and there isn't like one defined standard of beauty here because we model <speaker1>: beauty here because we've got people from like all over the world. it's really hard to be like hey, this is what beauty looks like. then what about everyone else? right? it's not just about like physical beauty, but like inner beauty and like the personality the person has and like what they're trying to do for their community. because a lot of the girls who were in the top eight like they weren't like professional models or anything. i was, but like some of them were like one of them was a tuition teacher. one of them was a swimmer and one of model <speaker1>: be this wholesome and wholehearted person. so i think that's what the singapore pageant is trying to push and like break this misconception. one of the unique things about the singapore pageant as well is that we have these like pillars that kind of define what the pageant is about. it's a women empowerment, sustainability and tech. like in terms of technology, we had a virtual show this year instead of a physical one, because obviously covid, and (um), it helps reduce the amount of waste we create, and like you know, it's also in line with sustainability. so we had this like virtual model <speaker1>: so when you were crowned miss universe singapore, how did you feel at that moment? model <speaker1>: so and so you are miss universe singapore. then the person like, (oh) my god, thank you. (oh), i couldn't believe it like so so that everyone like all eight girls had to film that like fake reaction for the show. the the people who edited the video and my national director were the only people who knew who won. so no one else knew and we had to watch the entire show along with like the audience and whoever else was watching to find out who won. so when i saw that, i literally reacted the same way i reacted on the on the video and i was like model <speaker1>: ya, like the real reaction came out. i saw the i saw the video of you going (oh) my god, (oh) my god. i was like, then when she told me that it was a, it was not the real reaction. i was like, wait, what? you mean you all weren't standing there when this happened? no, we were not. (oh) my goodness. we were in a restaurant. we were eating dinner. (oh), you were in a restaurant. yeah, we were in a restaurant. we were eating dinner. all of us were just waiting model <speaker1>: so after you won (um) miss universe singapore, then that you progress to going to the international miss universe right? so this is a natural like process for most of the contestants. so when you win the national pageant, then you represent your country at the international miss universe. but (um), there's always a choice. it's not like forced. if you win the national one and you decide that you know what, this is not for me. i'm i. i learned my lesson, and i like, i don't want to do this anymore. model <speaker1>: like i don't want to do this anymore. then you can always step back. and (um), once i won, i started stalking all the other girls who had won from different countries to see like who is my competition. and like you know, try to figure out. and obviously, when you, when you see people on social media, it's different from who they are in real life. but i think it's really about embracing who you are as a person. and i think people did like that when i was at miss universe. that i was a little bit different. like i cut model <speaker1>: i want to say that like that, the fact that you you you cut your hair short right and then you went for the international beauty was it deliberate or like you just did it? <speaker2>: so it was deliberate. it was kind of like a a strategy move because when you're at miss universe, everyone always assumes that we have this huge team of makeup artists helping us everyday, you know, with all the photoshoots and stuff, but actually we have to do our makeup ourselves. so even the makeup you see on stage for the actual show and like me, you know, i had model <speaker1>: i'll do a little bit with like lashes and things that are a bit hard. but because there's like eighty girls there and like ten makeup artists, there's no way that they can get through everyone, so you have to do most of it. i would say like eighty percent of it you have to do yourself and then they will just help you with like a nice lip color that they have or like a lashes or something. but the reason why we cut our hair off is because when we do makeup, we also have to do our own hair and hair takes a lot of time. so we model <speaker1>: i have like a month to prepare for this. there's no way i can learn to perfect my hair technique as well. so it's like you know what, just let's just cut it off and see see what happens. and so yeah, the haircut was a strategic move and i think it really helped because (um), i did save a lot of time. i could wake up fifteen minutes later every day, so i didn't have to do my hair, but my roommate, who is miss universe philippines, she would wake up earlier than me and she would like fan girl moment. < model <speaker1>: i love pageants. yeah, she's such a sweetheart. i forgot my tooth. i packed everything. i forgot my toothbrush when i went to miss universe and the first day she met me, she was like i have a spare one here. you can take it. so she's like super sweet and she helped me out a lot and she was like when you do makeup, do it like this, because she has experience right, so she would like teach me and she would lend me like whatever products that she's like. hey, you can use this. i mean, you mentioned you have model <speaker1>: so like the big gown everything on the the national costume and stuff which is like some of the national costumes there are crazy. they have this like huge like frame on the back. exactly so they obviously have people who can like kind of help you wear it but you have to do majority of the things yourself like you are the only person setting it up yourself. also right. so one day before, especially the national costume show, one day before that you would see girls like laying out all the different elements of their national costume because some of them had like a headpiece and then like. model <speaker1>: cause some of them had like a headpiece and then like this like frame with like wings or something. and then like you know things that go on the arm and like on the leg and everything. <speaker2>: ship it over. <speaker1>: some of them like there were huge boxes. actually, you really have to have drive and like, like the energy to push through something like that. but i think once you you put on that entire costume and you get on stage right, it's like a completely different feeling that you've never felt before and to me it's kind of worth model <speaker1>: and stuff before i went to the pageant because i'm from an immigrant family. my parents moved here in nineteen ninety eight and i was born here. but obviously, there's been a bit of xenophobia in singapore where people are like not very open. like after i won, there was a lot of comments on some forums. like, (oh), should she be representing singapore? she looks like a man. especially after i cut my hair off. and so, (oh), you said that. yeah, so what the heck? so for a few days i was like, what is going on? model <speaker1>: you know i was like seriously thinking like if i go and like represent my country will people actually support me, you know, or would i just receive like hate for it? right? so i was actually kind of scared. yeah. but i think once i was there it felt like i was able to do something good and show that like you know there's no one right way to represent singapore. even though we don't want to say it like there's no one standard of beauty in singapore. there is like a certain look when you think about it, be it for a male or female right when model <speaker1>: like conventional beauty or attractiveness, so it's a good thing that the in in singapore, what we're trying to do is also move away from that and like increase the diversity also and like representation of people who are there, but it's unfortunately there are just people on the internet who are stuck in like the nineteen hundreds or god knows what era who like literally only see things like have you not walked outside and like seen people and like i just cannot. i cannot appreciate like anything other than what they think is the acceptable standard of beauty. model <speaker1>: is the acceptable standard of beauty right, which is like what we are hoping to change even on instagram? i don't think like we should conform to only having a certain type of person on the channel. and like, i mean, everybody has a story to share, like everyone can learn something from everyone. yeah, correct. but if you're gonna like, bully me about like my skin color or like my family, like history and stuff, i really don't know what to say, because like what am i supposed to do? yeah, exactly. it's just crazy. yeah, it model <speaker1>: but i'm glad that you know, (um), they had to like, eat their words, because when you qualified as like the semi-finalist, i was like damn, and then i watched the video. it was so funny. okay, please tell me to explain your face. so there's like eighty girls all standing on stage, and then that's the first cut of girls getting into the top sixteen. it's like every single girl on that stage is like, oh my god, just let me in, please. i worked so hard for this. it's like so model <speaker1>: like one in five probability. so so it's not that high. when they were calling on the first name, i was like, (oh my gosh), if they call singapore right now, i will lose my mind. and then they call france, and i was like, okay, they never called singapore. okay, whatever. then they call colombia. i was like, okay. maybe they're not going to call singapore, even though there were like sixteen spots. but like you have to wait and wait. so i was kind of like losing hope. and then i was like, okay maybe they model <speaker1>: i will be able to make it. you know, a lot of thoughts were going through my head. i will admit i was feeling a bit like, (um), stressed or like i was standing there and comparing myself actively against all these other girls. and then when they, when they said singapore, and it was like steve harvey, and he has this booming voice, he goes singapore, and then i'm just like, at first, i was like, what? what just happened? i think my brain wasn't processing my body was like, we need to go right now. model <speaker1>: (oh) my gosh. model <speaker1>: (oh), like you know, like do some very like standard reaction. but then the moment on stage, i actually happened. my face was like all these all these like plans that i had completely thrown out the window. you know, like, like the pure shock expression on my face actually came out. when you made it and then you walked on the stage. then it was very funny because i think when i watched the video right then you were like a bit like, like calmly. i was like what happens? (oh), my feet were shaking. i was like, please don't fall next to model <speaker1>: so funny. i love you. <speaker2>: when you made it to the top sixteen and then you flew back after that, you know after the whole competition. then what was everyone's reaction? <speaker1>: like every single friend who i've ever talked to in my entire life, like every classmate from like six years ago, everyone's like messaging me like, oh my god, <speaker2>: (oh). model <speaker1>: everyone's like messaging me like, oh my god, you did this thing. like congrats and stuff. it was really nice to like reconnect with people who i didn't speak to for a while. and i think like whenever you achieve something or whenever you post that you know you did something, sometimes friends who you never talked to in like a long time come back and you connect with them again. so that was nice. and then i was on the bus going home that day, and there was this lady sitting in like the front two seats. her and her friend. the lady turns around behind her and model <speaker1>: what's going on and then from the front of the bus she screams at me you're the miss universe singapore and i'm like i'm like (oh) this is because of that i was like yes that's me hi and they're like they confirm damn shocked you're taking bus like no i don't think so she probably like why does miss universe take bus tong so i think she was trying to process like is that actually her because what is she doing here i was just wearing random t-shirt and jeans holding my laptop and like tote bag and like normal university outfit and model <speaker1>: and she was like trying to figure out. is this actually that girl? and it was really funny. (ah), that like i'm in the most random situations and people keep like recognizing me. (ah), i think they. they perceive it to be like very like. like a atas thing. so then when they see you on the bus and i'm like, (huh), why are you here? ya? it's so funny. but but yeah, i mean, even when i went there, like you have this perception that (oh), like miss universe, like brazil or whatever they model <speaker1>: i have a day job back at home and then like now i'm here now i have to go back to my job after this. so i'm here on leave. you know i'm here on. model <speaker1>: the fact that i won miss universe singapore and (um), she held this like, she holds this quiz at the beginning of class sometimes, and then one of the last question was like which one of the following was place top sixteen miss universe and she put like the other girl's name, and she put my name there. what? no way. so she's like upset every time i come into the class. she'll be like nithya, vanash, singapore, which is how i introduced myself when when i was there at the competition. so (um), it's nice to see model <speaker1>: coming interesting things that you are planning on doing. we've got interesting shoots coming up and i'm gonna start like a series of youtube videos or something like that with the other some of the other miss universe girls. (um), so that we can share our experiences and talk about like what it's really like to be at miss universe. it's not just like me talking, but you really get the stories and the experiences of the other miss universe contestants. i just want people to know that it's not just a frivolous thing that people do and it's actually quite meaningful. i think model <speaker1>: people to join and to get that that life changing experience that i got. if anyone is thinking of joining or like should i join? i would just say go for it and see what happens because you can learn a lot from this experience. one final curious question. (uh), is that do you have the opportunity to say the iconic like one answering one of the judges' questions moment? i did have that in the miss universe singapore. one. the question was. (um), what is the essence of a singaporean woman? i think my answer was something like. (um), the essence of a singapore woman model <speaker1>: the sense of a singaporean woman to me is someone who is open-minded and kind. (um), because we do have a lot of diversity in singapore, and it's always important to keep our minds open to accepting other people's opinions and views. and singapore is also changing as well. (um), we're not the same country we were fifty years ago, and we will continue to change. so (um), as society grows and progresses, (um), like i said, it's very important to be open-minded and think about how we can all live together as a society model <speaker1>: i think that's one of the like strongest answers that i've ever given and i think that's what kind of helped me get the miss universe singapore like title. i think (um), the judges saw that i, i really came from the heart like i genuinely meant it when (um), i think we should all be more open minded and accepting of everyone around us. i was like, thank god i didn't say something stupid. no, thank god you didn't end up as miss universe. model <speaker1>: no, thank god you didn't end up on miss universe fails. like, oh my god, i love that. <speaker2>: they asked a question. i'm like, (uh), (uh), and then i looked blank. i didn't want to do that. you know, cause that happens sometimes. <speaker1>: yeah, i totally get it. but i guess that was a great way to end this video cause i think that was like you know, the final question. then we final question for the video. so you're so smart guys. i should. < model <speaker1>: i will participate again. (oh my god), i want to be the miss zula. miss zula, i'm dead. i love it. i love it. okay. <speaker2>: or you should do a video where i judge and all the all the people who work at zula. you come, you walk. i will (oh my god), we are. you should do it. if you want to, because i want to see you. i want to see you do it. yeah. <speaker1>: oh my god, if you guys want to watch that video, you model <speaker1>: with us as well as like everyone who is watching, (um), i think the takeaways (uh), at the end there's like many, but (uh), ultimately it's good to see that you know things are changing in this industry and also how how impactful this competition was for you. and not only that, you know how you're also a very like tired university student at the heart of it, you know, heart of it all vibes. we love you guys. like this video. leave it in the comments below. tell us what you like about it. also, let us know who model <speaker1>: episode of asala, (ah), and don't forget to like, share, subscribe, subscribe, and yeah, we'll see you next time. bye.",85.54411764705883,78.21882951653944

(wah) ustaz is very difficult. i was hoping for another one. but okay, (lah), we'll go with ustaz. wait, so, can you like explain first of all? like what exactly is an ustaz? <speaker2>: (uh), so, when an ustaz is actually a religious teacher. (lah), if you want to translate it right, model <speaker1>: because the islamic religious council has set (err) guidelines and rules and it's a certificate. (ah), they call it (ah) ras (ah) asatizah recognition scheme. if you have a rumaan and ustad, i think the minimum is that you need to be (err) like jc level like that (lah) right, but in islamic studies (lah) right, right, right, right. but then there are tiers also, (err) tiers so like (err) for me, i'm tier one. okay, there's also a tier two meaning model <speaker1>: highest or the highest? <speaker2>: the highest, but not really like high. (lah). <speaker1>: (lah), (lah), (lah). <speaker2>: but thirty years of age already like (wah) (lah). <speaker3>: i'm just like a teacher, (lah). <speaker4>: okay, so yeah, (uh), so like tier one, you can teach (uh) subjects in religion, (lah). but tier two is more like quranic reading and more to the basics. what's the highest religious leader rank, mufti in this model <speaker1>: who who who who who who who? <speaker2>: what is that? <speaker1>: is there a global mufti? <speaker2>: there's no global mufti. <speaker1>: (uh), but there are muftis that are like, maybe more popular. (lah). <speaker2>: right, right, right. what do you teach? because like, like the quran is in (um), what language? arabic? arabic? right? so then is it? are the teachers mainly translating the teachings and then commu~ conveying them to to the younger generation? or model <speaker1>: do the pillars of faith and so on. or maybe i'm invited to teach at other mosques. also, <speaker2>: (ah), okay. <speaker1>: why did you choose to do this? the one that decided for me, right, (uh), it's my father. <speaker2>: (oh), i thought you were going to say god. then i was like, (ah), my eye will roll. (ah), <speaker1>: when he said father god, he's getting there. different already. okay, (uh), after god, (ah), model <speaker1>: he never said that but along the way like i thought about it and i still remember at sec three he asked me where i want to continue study. i didn't know what to answer. <speaker2>: right. <speaker1>: then he planted the idea that or maybe can go saudi arabia, medina, (lah) okay, (ah), then i said okay, (lah) can (ah), so there's the journey starts. <speaker2>: is he also securing his own spot in heaven? was your dad also a ustaz? <speaker1>: he was. he was. model <speaker1>: my mother and my father both are not really your ustaza (lah) the the female term is ustaza (hm) <speaker2>: you're on the journey together (lah) you and your parents in that sense <speaker1>: in that sense <speaker2>: but they tear one or not <speaker1>: i don't think so <speaker2>: why you gonna flex on his parents <speaker1>: so like at what age did you go to saudi arabia <speaker2>: like nineteen twenty (ah) twenty <speaker1>: by yourself <speaker2>: (uh) with model <speaker1>: (ah), because the king sponsors those who want to study religion. <speaker2>: (oh), okay. <speaker1>: i think like a lot of people were asking when they knew that we were going to interview at ustaz. they were asking what's the difference between (uh) ustaz and (uh) imam. <speaker2>: ustaz is a religious teacher. imam is a leader. so if you translate it directly, leader, but usually imam, (uh), different country, different (uh) definitions. (err), for singapore, if you say imam, it will be model <speaker1>: can also not be an ustaz, but an ustaz supposedly should be an imam, (lah), (ah), if not for the community, then for the family, (ah), the layman can also be an imam for the family, (lah), right, right, right, so technically you are also an imam, <speaker2>: at the mosque, at the mosque, ya, <speaker1>: do singaporean muslims practice islam very differently from like the rest of the world? okay, maybe the rest of the world is a bit broad, (lah), like malaysia, our neighbouring country, < model <speaker1>: so the more popular ones are the four schools of thought. so in southeast asia we hold on to the shafi'i school of thought, but in regions such as saudi arabia they have the hanbali school of thought. in africa, maliki, and in india or pakistan they have the hanafi so forth. so what are some examples of like the differences between these schools of thought? <speaker2>: there's nothing that is fundamentally different. okay, but in terms of practice that we might differ in (uh), branches. they call them branches. i mean, if i pray, i might read model <speaker1>: (uh), i might read something that (uh), the other school of thoughts might not read, and vice versa. so it's like nothing major. it doesn't (uh) compromise your standing in front of god. everybody gets to go to heaven. like ya. so it's not so. so is it like when it comes to christianity, there's like the presbyterian. all these different denominations. is that the same? <speaker2>: (uh), similar, similar, similar, but (uh), for okay, schools of thoughts that i mentioned, the four schools of thought is model <speaker1>: worship, <speaker2>: right, <speaker1>: (ah), it's more to worship. okay, so (ah), just now i saw you like frown when i say everybody can go to heaven like that. so that's why you're like that. <speaker2>: no, i mean, as in the four schools right, nobody says, (err), you gonna go to hell or something, because the fundamentals are the same like believe in one god and ya (lah) pillars of islam, pillars of faith. <speaker1>: there's hell right in in islam. model <speaker1>: one can try to imagine but it's unimaginable by men. (lah). so that's the rough depiction. okay, (uh), hell. there's quite a lot more depictions of tortures and stuff like that. (ah), no, i actually, i'm more curious about heaven because like, like, what is the christian depiction of heaven? right? (hm), (hm), (hm). i mean, i'm catholic. (lah). (hm). bothers me, but hell's worse. i agree with that. (ah), ya, ya, ya. model <speaker1>: like i, i could be wrong on my memory filming. maybe i made this up straight right, but i remember it's like it's like like jerusalem and then the floors are lined with like gems and gold. yeah, and then you sit with god and his angels and have meals and all that stuff. then i'm thinking cool. <speaker2>: yeah, yeah, but where's the entertainment right? i want to know what we're gonna be doing in between. <speaker1>: you can do whatever you want. because like i will imagine in heaven is like whatever you want model <speaker1>: is it controllable? (err) no, so i'm curious about heaven because like i've always heard about the seventy two virgins. what's up with that? is that real? that can't be real. what did you hear? i hear that if you do good things, then when you go to heaven, then you will get up to seventy two virgins. up to seventy two. so which is what the narrative of many of the early nine eleven attacks, when they uncover the motivations behind those people and they say, (um), god promised me seventy two virgins to be a martyr. model <speaker1>: to disclaim first right, (uh), (uh), because that usually comes from a hadis, hadis are sayings by the prophet. okay, and when it comes to sayings of the prophet, their sayings are authentic and their sayings are not authentic. so for the particular one that nine eleven, i don't know whether it's authentic or not. (lah). okay, but the idea of (uh) angels, we call them angels. it's not like the angel archangel and nothing. (ah), but this one is (uh) in malay we call it bidadari. model <speaker1>: so like if you're a man and you're in heaven, then you will be able to have these beings (lah) okay for your pleasure. <speaker2>: but then it's regardless what you do as long as you're in heaven you will have access to this is it? <speaker1>: yeah, so right. <speaker2>: it's like a ai concierge. <speaker1>: so where seventy two come from? <speaker2>: okay, maybe in the particular narration there the the the number seventy two is put (lah), or maybe seventy. <speaker1 model <speaker1>: when there are narrations that have the number seven, (ah) seventy, it just means that there will be a lot. (ah), okay, so ya to your heart's desire, (lah), okay. the description of heaven is that, (ah), whatever that the eye has not seen, whatever that the ear has not heard, and whatever the the nose has not smelt, and like you, you cannot imagine (lah), basically, (ah), okay. model <speaker1>: which really impacted me right that with the floor is lined with gold and whatever there was one server he just randomly said right don't chase after what they walk on in heaven and then i think that really changed my perspective of like money and stuff of like what i want to look for in life. now it's all bitcoin. no, sorry. sorry. sorry. sorry. okay. okay. okay. yeah, when they update the bible right then we're like god will just give you bitcoin. speaking of updating like the biblical texts. model <speaker1>: the bible text or holy text right like do you think that islam has kind of have to adapt to like modern day cultures and stuff? <speaker2>: there definitely will be some so called adaptations. (lah). okay, (uh), one simple example is during covid we pray (uh) with gaps. <speaker1>: (oh) so social distancing when you pray. <speaker2>: social distancing. (ah), ya ya. so these are adaptations and these are things that the mufti. the mufti is the highest order. (lah) above the tier one. (ah), ya. so model <speaker1>: so are all malays born muslim? model <speaker1>: muslim family then yes, but if they are not then <speaker2>: what what i thought was interesting is that you know if you convert to any religion you convert but when you convert to (uh) islam you revert because that was supposed to be your original. yeah, we are just finding god again. right, right? i thought that was beautiful. do you agree? <speaker1>: i still catholic girl. <speaker2>: ya (lah) ya. i'm asking whether you agree or not. <speaker1>: i just thought it was beautiful. <speaker2>: later, father call model <speaker1>: like a few years back, (lah) because it's it's not it hasn't been like that for all over. <speaker2>: (oh) ya. okay, okay, okay. we we we learned it from one of a documentary we did of (um) of a chinese girl that converted to islam to marry her (uh) husband and then she talked about how the faith is beautiful. <speaker1>: (oh) okay. <speaker2>: ya. actually, nowadays a lot of the marriages have become civil marriages. right? what are your thoughts on that? <speaker model <speaker1>: people to be muslim. what? (ah) so if let's say it's the choice of the person to not become a muslim or maybe he wants or she wants to retain the muslim name but wants to marry somebody else, then ya, it's it's their choice (lah). but our islamic law in this country states that it cannot happen. (lah). it needs to go through the process of muslim marriage. rmm. <speaker2>: does the community shun them? yeah, like is it generally frowned upon? <speaker1>: it is frowned upon. okay, (uh model <speaker1>: what happens happens. (ah), ya. i. i think it's interesting because i'm from malaysia and i know like in malaysia, if you are non-muslim and you want to marry a muslim, you have to convert no matter what. like we don't have that option like we do in singapore. right? <speaker2>: (oh), you mean you cannot do a civil marriage in malaysia? <speaker1>: no, you can't. (hm). so so then like what you have. i mean, i don't know of friends, but i know of friends model <speaker1>: slightly better to have that option. but if a muslim marries a non-muslim in a civil marriage, like, are they still accepted in the community? are they still able to to go to the mosque and still like worship? model <speaker1>: but by the rule book they can still come in and pray (lah) right. <speaker2>: yeah, definitely. <speaker1>: okay. it's good to know. <speaker2>: they can practice on their own event (lah) (uh), just that what they do as in marrying outside of (uh), the sharia court (ah) in singapore is a sin (lah) okay, it's a sin and whatever entails that is also (uh) sinful. i guess. <speaker1>: is that like an unforgivable high tier sin? <speaker2>: no model <speaker1>: right, i was reading about that. what? what does that mean? like a, like a, like a false prophet or like a? <speaker2>: no, meaning that (err) like you need to believe that there's only one true god. <speaker1>: right. <speaker2>: (err) for us, which is allah (lah). okay, if you convert (lah), then that's the biggest sin (lah). <speaker1>: yeah. <speaker2>: okay. <speaker1>: so if you convert (lah) then that's the bigger sin model <speaker1>: pray (lah). you pray then you, but there are there are factors to (uh) which make the repentance acceptable or not. one is that you need to be regretful. another is that you cannot repeat the same mistakes again. you cannot repeat the same mistakes. that's something that's really impossible. like i mean, i'm clearly not exemplary catholic. <speaker2>: from a simple man. <speaker1>: but you go and like, you know, i pissed my mother off. i watch porn. then it's like i know i'm going to watch porn again model <speaker1>: until ya, i struggle. you know what i'm saying. <speaker2>: okay, (lah). so at the point at the point where you want to make the repentance, you need to be sincere. (lah). <speaker1>: sincere. <speaker2>: and try as much as possible not to do (lah). if let's say you do again, then you you try to repent again. (lah). < speaker1>: right, right. <speaker2>: but if let's say you're repenting, then you think in your head, (err), later model <speaker1>: does having like president halimah make a difference to you? <speaker2>: ya, okay, (uh), for me, ya, it's a different (lah). it shows that (uh), women are empowered and also not just any woman, the muslim woman. and ya, when president halimah is the president, it is the example for our youngsters to look up to (lah) to (lah) to aspire to be high officers as well. <speaker1>: right, right to aspire to be high officer as well. <speaker2>: ya. hopefully (lah). <speaker model <speaker1>: feminism right, because i think even in christian text also there is some form of like people usually take it that like the man is written to be of a higher position than the woman. (lah) <speaker2>: (hm) <speaker1>: and so just because you're tall. <speaker2>: he's helping you. he's trying to become a bigger asshole. <speaker1>: so i'm curious like what does consent look like right between a married muslim couple? so i was reading somewhere where they were talking about that some muslim women felt that they were compelled to have sex model <speaker1>: women felt that they were compelled to have sex with their husbands even though they like didn't feel like it because they felt that there was a quote that the angels will curse them if they say no and i think like with other things, for example, men can have four wives all this kind of stuff. what is there really that sexism in islam? <speaker2>: i cannot deny that, ya in islam, even in the malay culture, also there's this concept of ladies asking from the man permission and stuff like that. however, the times that we are living in these days, right, it' model <speaker1>: days right, it's (uh), people are called more woke. (uh), (uh), i would choose to believe that it's not just the woman that needs to ask permission from the man. okay, but vice versa. (uh), (ah), it's the man also needs to do the same. and marriage is not just (uh), you have one leader. so called the man become the leader and the whole family needs to follow every single thing. marriage is an institution where you work together. yeah, so (uh), the question about (uh), (uh) going to model <speaker1>: and (uh), it's supposed to be discussed between husband and wife also (lah), okay, and if let's say the the husband wants to (uh), so called (ah), (uh), assert assert his rights, okay, and say (err), you need to only you need to have it with me and (uh), if you do not do so then the angels will curse you. it already speaks volumes about their marriage in the first place, right? so it's not like it's not like a muslim law or something. it's like a misinterpretation of the teachings model <speaker1>: (ah), it's a ill practice of sorts (lah) like people use it for their own convenience to <speaker2>: right, stop raping your wives, guys. <speaker1>: ya. <speaker2>: i would say it's misapplication and also (uh), like the education doesn't reach yet. (lah) it's like it's not about the like (uh), like having sex and so on (lah). okay, it's not about that. it's not even about the angels cursing you kan, but it's about (uh), the model <speaker1>: happiness of the family, but then they zoom in on the small small things like, (err), you need to (err), you need (err) to be submissive to your husband. so like further back there was even this so-called obedient wives club that existed. that was basically they were called out by aware because it was apparently an organisation which promotes harmonious families by teaching wives how to be submissive to their husbands. and i think this word, the submissive word, has taken quite a negative light, right? so i'm just curious, what does it actually mean? like when they say, for example model <speaker1>: like when they say like for example, like submit to your husbands, (uh), i'm not sure how the quran phrases it. (lah). <speaker2>: okay, (uh), the quran, i don't think has any specific verses (uh) that touches upon this being submissive. alright, and (uh), when we talk about being submissive, i guess (uh), from their point of view, that anything that the husband say the wife need to follow. but if let's say (uh), you are asking them to be submissive in every single thing, even the things that your model <speaker1>: again, why are you even married to each other? <speaker2>: right. no, so basically the quran doesn't say that like women listen to men. (lah). <speaker1>: (uh), not specifically like that. (lah). so not being submissive. <speaker2>: it's just some people interpret it that way. (lah). and then they just okay. <speaker1>: or maybe they don't even put the don't take the quran. (lah). they might take some verses from the hadith. and ya, so some teachings from in a nutshell model <speaker1>: so (uh) ustad can get married, imams can get married. (uh) ya, we are just like normal people, just that we teach religion. (ah), right, right. <speaker2>: so you both you both are ustad and ustad. (ah), <speaker1>: (um), my wife, (uh) ya, she is, but she is not working in the field. (ah), right. <speaker2> she also has a day job. another day job. <speaker1>: ya, and it's not related at all to (uh model <speaker1>: (ah), okay, but i did not date her or anything. <speaker2>: never. <speaker1>: (err), cannot. <speaker2>: so when you first dated her, you really got, let me given that your your parents are that staunch right? <speaker1>: (ah). <speaker2>: so you really had an adult guardian to bring you all on dates. <speaker1>: okay, i. <speaker2>: because you all cannot go one on one right before you're married. <speaker1>: a (ah), okay, so okay, let's model <speaker1>: (uh-huh). <speaker2>: (uh-huh), (uh-huh). okay, my father approached me, then my father asked me, (uh-huh), okay, (uh-huh) who do you want to marry? just like that. okay, who do you want to just marry? <speaker1>: (huh), (huh). <speaker2> eddie, eddie, eddie, eddie. <speaker1>: eddie, eddie, eddie eddie. <speaker2>: eddie, eddie, (huh), eddie, eddie, eddie <speaker1>: eddie. <speaker2> model <speaker1>: in one night and when i ya, it all happened in one night and like (uh), my father like like wanna give the (uh) offer. okay, i told him that (oh), actually, i actually have somebody. (uh), somebody that i like (lah). okay, then my father asked who, so i revealed to him my wife. then (uh), <speaker2>: wait, so you were gonna offer someone else? <speaker1>: arrange marriage. (lah), like that. ya, (uh), (uh), (uh). <speaker2>: wait. how old are model <speaker1>: so (uh) after that my father asked my sister to contact the girl which was my wife. (lah) ya. <speaker2>: the girl know she like her or not. <speaker1>: when contact, yes, (lah) with before that don't know (lah). <speaker2>: (huh), like that. <speaker1>: so when you tell your father that no, i have someone that i want to marry. she doesn't know that you want to marry her yet. <speaker2>: (uh), (huh), (huh), (uh), (huh). model <speaker1>: okay, drag until then. how faster go instagram, drag find in the. so okay, then you get your sister to help you start into her dm. then <speaker2>: (uh), so we were engaged for ya. she accepted me and then we were engaged for two years. (ah), <speaker1>: do you know what her first reaction was like? she actually like you or not at that point? <speaker2>: i mean she has two (lah). no, no, no, no, (lah). i don't think so. (lah). no, why? it model <speaker1>: one stability. what? <speaker2>: wait, but you all have no idea like she doesn't know who you are. <speaker1>: (ah), from school ya (lah). <speaker2>: (ah), so you all are friends already. <speaker1>: friends, but never contact (lah), like (uh), acquaintances. (ah), right, right, right. <speaker2>: from the moment your sister reach out, you all are considered engaged and she agree, then you all are engaged already. <speaker1> no, we had a proper meet up. (ah model <speaker1>: but (uh), like i thought about it for and i prayed and everything (lah) ya ya ya ya ya ya. it's more it's more to her her side of the story (lah) ya ya. i think the dilemma is more to her (lah). <speaker2>: what is it? what is it? what's this? <speaker1>: it's like a pitch process. you know you have to like pitch and say hey. <speaker2>: (oh) sorry sorry there's so much to unpack. <speaker1>: is this not? is this model <speaker1>: no, but he is really the is like the arranged marriage. <speaker2>: sorry, sorry, sorry. <speaker1>: (ah), sorry, sorry, sorry. he is personal curiosity and no one else gonna benefit from this. okay, so i, i just want to understand the timeline. (ah), so your your dad asked you that night. then you suspected he was gonna matchmake you with someone else. you'll be like, nope, i have a bae. and then you tell him who the bae is. your sister reached out. right. that's when the girl for model <speaker1>: and then (ah), she said okay, she wanted some time to think about it. how long was that time? <speaker2>: i think days or two weeks. <speaker1>: (oh) my god, i dated my wife for ten years before i proposed. <speaker2>: then she asked some very essential questions. (lah), like how old am i? how old are you? (ah), how old is she? (ah), like (ah), am i somebody that can get angry easily? all that stuff. (lah), so my sister. <speaker1>: so she' model <speaker1>: so my sister, so she's probably very religious also, (lah) the fact that she bought into everything. <speaker2>: so my father agree also because my father like (uh), have have met (uh), the father in the mosque like that (lah), but not not friends, you know, like acquaintances. <speaker1>: (hm), (hm), (hm). <speaker2>: know each other, (lah). <speaker1>: in that couple of weeks where you waited for her to come back, right, to to give you an answer, did you talk to her? model <speaker1>: i, i, i pray for what's best (lah). <speaker2>: ya, but what's best ideally is her. okay, okay, so two weeks later, then she, she don't text you (lah). <speaker1>: (uh), she text my sister (lah). your sister is ultimate wingman. <speaker2>: (wah), but what an exciting moment for him when your sister, you know what i mean, everyday you're like, (err), she text you or not. <speaker1>: ya, ya, ya, ya. <speaker model <speaker1>: so what was that first meeting like? like the two families need to meet right? then what do you all talk about at that meeting? <speaker2>: you blush like shit first. <speaker1>: (ah), kind of (lah). yeah, a lot of things. a lot of things happen. (ah), just (ah), small talk and stuff like that. and then (ah), this is the normal customs. (ah), the like we call it apa engagement kan ya engagement. (ah), so after all the small talk, then after eat, then (ah), okay. so why model <speaker1>: (hm), (hm), (hm). <speaker2>: (hm), (huh). <speaker1>: (hm). <speaker3>: (hm), (uh), (huh). < speaker2>: (hm), <speaker1>: (huh). <speaker2>: okay, so (uh), ya (lah), okay, then we set (uh), there was an exchange of (uh), i gave her a ring (lah), then she gave me a watch, not this one. okay, ya, she gave. model <speaker1>: gave me a watch, not this one. okay, ya. she gave me a watch. ya. so after that we agreed to two years and ya, like two years to engage. (ah), engagement. ya, which can call off (lah). can ya? can ya? <speaker2>: (oh), so you do that already? then the two years is for you to date. <speaker1>: but i was one year. i was in (ah), doing my studies (ah) in saudi arabia. <speaker2>: ldr long distance. <speaker1>: long distance. okay model <speaker1>: strict strict family (lah). okay, so even when i was (uh), like ldr is like (uh), i cannot contact my wife or rather my fiance often. (uh) ya. so we exchange it exchange (uh) messages but not on a daily basis. so no no video calls and everything. no. why why cannot? they scared of sex (lah). presumably right. <speaker2>: but they are so far apart. <speaker1>: sex (lah). <speaker2>: (ah), sexed. <speaker1>: (oh), no. is that why they are scared model <speaker1>: (ah), ya (lah), (ah), ya. so like we try to safeguard ourselves then, like (uh), this last thing shouldn't shouldn't happen. (ah), ya. then (uh), the reason my father also don't want me to (uh), like engage in too much contact, (uh), messaging and stuff like that, because one thing might lead to another. then i never focus on my studies. (ah), also stuff like that. (ah), but after i came back from my studies, my wife also came back from my studies. (uh), wait model <speaker1>: okay, okay, okay. so because (err), i was finishing my studies, probably he had also a lot of offers. (err), (err), this guy. probably (lah) (lah) ya. i mean, to be honest, if his father is a stuntman, the son is going saudi arabia, sponsored by the king of saudi to study to be a stuntman. stuntman. he's like what you mean. like marrying him is like a (wah) superstar. so on the topic of wife, right of having. model <speaker1>: of wife right of having a wife like multiple marriages. (ah), (hm), (hm). <speaker2>: (ah), (hm). < speaker1>: four wives. no, not multiple wives. multiple wives. multiple marriages. (lah). <speaker2>: wait, but the the the man can have four wives but women can't have four husbands. <speaker1>: maybe you can marry all four at once. but why four? <speaker2>: (uh), this one. i need to take you back like to a history lesson. (ah), (ah), (ah). model <speaker1>: then there was no number. i think. (ah), so there was a companion who had ten wives. (oh) ya. and more. (ah), i guess. (ah), so when islam came, it set a limit to the number of wives that they could have. so this companion had ten wives. he had to let go of the six. (ah), so ya. so this is the cap. so now you see it from a different lens already. (ah), because it's from one to four. (ah), how come so many? actually, it was ten to four model <speaker1>: (ah), i mean, but based on your example, you know, you know, you can get another one. then, (ah), no, (ah), you know, you know. so it's like it puts a limit to the number of wives that you can have, which is four, and in the quran, the text is that (ah), you can marry two, three and four, but if let's say, (ah), you cannot be fair to them, then one is enough. so you have to treat them fairly, like love them fairly, will you not? model <speaker1>: ya ya ya ya ya ya. model <speaker1>: your brother in law, (err), no, not brother in law, like your brother die or something, then the in law, no more husband or the together family, then you can marry your sister in law. <speaker2>: (huh), that's true. <speaker1>: (hm), that could be a reason, but that's not the reason. you know, the reason is always like up to you (lah). it's whether your first wife. <speaker2>: singapore practices this. <speaker1>: singapore, (err), it allows more than one wife to be model <speaker1>: no, it's not. it's not. can run soon. but i'm not sure. okay, my pleasure. what the hell? no, so ya, but that can be one of the reasons. <speaker2>: that is just a reason. (ah), okay, but if let's say you don't have any reason, so you can take another wife, so long as you are capable. <speaker1>: so player be player. so it doesn't have to be your first wife, unable to bear you a child. then only then you can have a model <speaker1>: multiple marriages or he has two wives. but more than two i have not encountered before. <speaker2>: they tired. not like does their marriage work out? like is it healthy? <speaker1>: i think they work out. but i heard that early days not smooth. <speaker2>: (hm), (hm), (hm). <speaker1>: and whether they tired or not, i see they are not tired. most probably this man. this man, they are like the calibre is different. <speaker2>: what you talking about? tongkeng lee. <speaker1>: no, model <speaker1>: ya, not necessarily that i mean like (uh), mentally, (uh), (uh), (uh). model <speaker1>: and then they all have to live together also (lah). <speaker2>: (uh), no, the person needs to (uh), prepare a separate (uh) quarters for the wife or maybe separate house even (lah). <speaker1>: (ah), that's why in singapore financially (oh) <speaker2>: yes, yes. <speaker1>: wait, but then why cannot do the opposite? so can women then take four husband? <speaker2>: (hm), <speaker1>: and why not? <speaker2>: okay, this is like one of the most difficult questions. model <speaker1>: say that dna testing will be viable already, so i thought about it again, and (uh), if let's say one husband can give the wife a child easier than the other husband, okay, then the other husband also wants a child, then how would the first husband be able to be together with the wife? <speaker2>: (hm), but it's the same thing. what? <speaker1>: but you have to wait. <speaker2>: can i give you what i think is the answer? <speaker1>: okay, can <speaker2>: i think in many religions right model <speaker1>: on life from cultures right is to do with creating as many descendants and offspring that are that will be believers. this is so we are basically building our tribe right and much like how like what i believe for example no premarital sex is so that people will want to get married people will want to practice monogamy so that you don't die so that you don' t get stds then you will have a child as soon as possible if you are monogamous. model <speaker1>: as soon as possible if you are monogamous slash did not have premarital sex. that encourages people to show inside (lah) right because you only got this one chance right and as young as possible then you have as many babies as possible. if i extrapolate this theory right onto the muslim faith but once again tier zero chinese guy. (err), tier zero is higher than tier one. (oh) damn. then then it will be about once again procreation creating more muslim members of the tribe. (hm). model <speaker1>: more muslim members of the tribe. and so a woman can only give birth to one child a year, maximum two if you time it right. whereas a man can impregnate have an unlimited upside to the amount of children he can create in a year. i mean if he wants to spree, he can make ten thousand. <speaker2>: (oh), (oh), (oh). <speaker1>: i mean, okay, (lah), (lah), (lah). <speaker2>: (err), (err), (err). <speaker1>: (err), (ah), (ah), ( model <speaker1>: that that if women date multiple men it does not help in procreation. model <speaker1>: like the patriarchy always existed. if let's say this religion come and say like you know, no patriarchy, the world would have rejected the religion and then it will not survive to this age. <speaker2>: (hm), for me, (uh), in islam, also kan this from the islamic (uh) perspective, (lah), we are. we like really emphasize on the idea of (uh) family institution. so if let's say the wife has (uh) more than one husband, then the family institution would not be (uh) as easy to manage. maybe the the model <speaker1>: so given the fact that like polygamy is okay for men right, is cheating a thing like cheating just not a thing because if i am talking to this another woman maybe i'm just considering her for second wife. what? <speaker2>: (hm), <speaker1>: or just marry her first, (lor) you know, not cheating. <speaker2>: (err), ya, ya, ya, ya. <speaker1>: (err), ya. (err), that's a weird loophole. (ah), <speaker2>: (um), <speaker1>: if for example, model <speaker1>: (ah), purely hypothetical that if let's say you were having dinner or like you know with with someone, (oh) sorry, i answered my own question already. he engaged before he go dating with his wife (leh). so if he's gonna do it the correct hundred percent way, he must announce engagement first before he can. <speaker2>: no, but he say that is not the common way that like other men would do. <speaker1>: no, that's not the common way today, (lah), right, but that's the traditional uncommon today. <speaker2 model <speaker1>: i guess so. yeah. model <speaker1>: flirt with other women also (lah) once they have their wives. how do i get another one? the correct process would be for the husband to speak to the wife first and say hey look you are not enough. what you are so amazing. but what you need someone else to be less amazing. ya so that you look no more amazing. you must be little yourself. it must be like i. i know there's there's like there's so many issues that i bring up and i got so many problems you need to deal with all this right. so i help split your burden with another model <speaker1>: another person <speaker2>: you get my good side. someone else needs to get my bad side. <speaker1>: yeah, but then that's not holy because you must be able to give equal. <speaker2>: girls, are you listening to this man making up lies? <speaker1>: lies. <speaker2>: no, no, no, that's a real question. though, how does how does one go on a hunt to find (um) wife number two in the correct way? <speaker1>: (uh), i, i can't answer this area. < model <speaker1>: they like (err), we want to find a third person partner. then right, they were like, they do. it has to be a stranger cannot be a friend. so then they start like interviewing nannies. <speaker2>: no, but then the woman cannot like the other woman (mah). it's damn difficult to get another woman. <speaker1>: it's already saying that the husband stars won't come here because they cannot associate the topics we're talking about. so if you think about this, the healthiest way right is to not make your cup, your first wife model <speaker1>: so we have solved it. <speaker2>: (oh), our conversation really went down here. <speaker1>: but to be honest, like (uh), this conversation i've never had before. <speaker2>: okay, okay. <speaker1>: and also like (uh), even i think among malays, also like we never like talk about this thing. (ah), like if you have one wife already, like one enough, one enough. (ah), one enough. <speaker2>: one wife. <speaker1>: one wife. < speaker2>: (ah), one wife model <speaker1>: for the sake of answering, (ah), if let's say it happens, (uh), it's probably the same way you find your first wife, (lah). <speaker2>: like what is the process? if let's say you identify a second wife, then what is the process? <speaker1>: if let's say, you really want the right way right then, (uh), you probably ask your wife, (lah), can you find for me another one? <speaker2>: (oh), that's how they kept me at one. <speaker1>: yeah model <speaker1>: like by now they must have four wives already. what you know i'm saying. <speaker2>: i'm trying to figure out how i can get more. <speaker1>: you cannot even get one. <speaker2>: if you have to ask your wife to find it, how would you ask your wife? how would you ask your wife to find? <speaker1>: the friends that have two wives, hor !(wah)! the first wife is one hell of a wife. sia. <speaker2>: or the marriage is to solve a problem. so like there's this story of model <speaker1>: he built this giant like compound and he has like ten wives, (err), but it's not because he horny or what, (err), it's because he was trying to bring people like little girls, especially right from the village where they they couldn't survive on their own and he bring them into his household. he marry them so they can take care of them. ya. isn't that? <speaker2>: i've heard this story. <speaker1>: (um), very altruistic. <speaker2>: the king of china with concubines, right where they live. model <speaker1>: the story was being told by the villagers who were jealous of the king, but actually he's a very good guy. <speaker2>: yeah, yeah, nice guy. <speaker1>: yeah, yeah, that's like every king in china. (lah). <speaker2>: how to become a king? <speaker1>: i'll build my own village. <speaker2>: thanks for the liana. <speaker1>: ya, thanks for the liana. my pleasure. <speaker2>: our pleasure. <speaker1>: hey guys, so this was part one of our model <speaker1>: we're gonna create a part two as well. stay tuned for that. if you like this video, do like it. also subscribe to this channel and we'll see you in the next one. bye bye. bye bye. thanks for joining us, sir. thank you. thank you.",78.54022988505747,83.90829694323143

the country's parliament as it reopens after a recess of a little more than two weeks. the recess, which happens when parliament is prorogued, typically marks the midpoint of the government's current term. madam halimah is expected to outline the government's priorities, policies and programs ahead of the remainder of its term. her speech comes as the nation rebounds from the impact of covid nineteen, but with the spectre of geopolitical tensions. model <speaker1>: specter of geopolitical tensions looming, madam halimah is expected to touch on how singapore can react in a changing world and rise to meet these challenges. you're watching live pictures right now from parliament house. the president's address tonight is going to kick off the second session of parliament. it's going to be a big one. model <speaker1>: parliament is going to be very closely watched coming in a time when singapore faces its multiple challenges. let's take you live now to parliament where president halimah yacob is entering the house and prepares to give her speech. model <speaker1>: honorable members, please be seated. model <speaker1>: well, president. model <speaker1>: of the pandemic because everyone played their part, we emerged stronger and more united than before. social capital amongst singaporeans has deepened. trust in government has strengthened and our global reputation has been enhanced. these strengths will prove crucial on the road ahead. the worst of covid nineteen is now hopefully behind us, but there are new challenges ahead. model <speaker1>: but there are new challenges ahead as we enter an increasingly dangerous and troubled world. the war in ukraine rages on and is unlikely to end soon. how the crisis unfolds will have major ramifications for the security of countries everywhere. the rivalry between the us and china continues to intensify and has recently taken a turn for the worse. near miss encounters. model <speaker1>: near miss encounters are happening more frequently around the taiwan strait and south china sea. neither side wants to go to war, but events have their own momentum and accidents can easily spiral out of control in ways no one can predict. the global order is also being reshaped by strategic geopolitical rivalry. the major powers are focused more on unilaterally securing their own. model <speaker1>: unilaterally securing their own advantage, then on promoting mutual interdependence or strengthening the multilateral system. the international norms that underpin peace and prosperity in the world are under severe strain. these are realities we have to adapt to as a small nation. we must take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be, but we are far from powerless on the international stage by. model <speaker1>: on the international stage by acting together with like-minded partners, both big and small, we remain vigilant and proactive in defending ourselves against external threats. we will continue to build a network of friends to advance our shared interests. we will strive to preserve our sovereignty and the right to determine our own future, as we have done since independence, against the backdrop of a great. model <speaker1>: against the backdrop of great power rivalry, smaller countries like singapore are experiencing growing pressures to take sides. we will be subject to foreign influences and disinformation campaigns aimed at shaping our domestic public opinion and pressing the government to adopt certain positions. we must do our utmost to resist such pressures. we have to close ranks and stay united, regardless of race. model <speaker1>: united regardless of race, religion or political affiliation, especially when it comes to core national interest, we must never allow external parties to divide us and should always stand together as one people to uphold singapore's vital interests. unity will also be important as we push forward against the economic headwinds, global trade and investment flows. model <speaker1>: global trade and investment flows are facing growing obstacles. governments in the major economies are providing substantial fiscal support to develop strategic industries and strengthen their own industrial bases. this creates a more uneven playing field and tougher competition for us. we will adapt to these new circumstances and find opportunities amidst the challenges. we cannot compete head-to-head. model <speaker1>: we cannot compete head to head with big powers seeking to control key technologies and industries in the global economy, but we can be more agile and nimble than others and respond more quickly and effectively to new challenges and opportunities. we will run up against more binding constraints in land, labor, and carbon over the coming years, and we will have to do our best to manage them, but even as we adjust and adapt. model <speaker1>: even as we adjust and adapt, a few fundamental imperatives will not change. we must stay connected to the world, strengthen our connectivity infrastructure, and entrench our position as a trusted and reliable business hub. we must develop talents and skills of our people throughout their careers, and continue to attract foreigners with entrepreneurial networks and expertise to help grow opportunities. model <speaker1>: help grow opportunities for singaporeans. we must invest in innovation to unlock new areas of growth, including in digitalisation and sustainability. importantly, we must nurture the strong tripartite partnership between government, businesses and workers. if we are adaptable and resourceful, we can strengthen our competitive advantage and position ourselves best to prosper and thrive. model <speaker1>: to prosper and thrive in this new environment to do well in this troubled world and remain one united people we will need to strengthen our social fabric every singaporean must feel that they have a stake in our country the fruits of our progress must be shared fairly and no one should feel left behind. this is the main purpose of the forward singapore exercise to renew and update. model <speaker1>: to renew and update our social compact even as we refresh our goals and strategies collectively, the four g team have engaged more than fourteen thousand singaporeans over the past six months and are continuing to deepen these engagements. this exercise reaffirms the core values that we hold dear as singaporeans, fairness, inclusivity, mutual support. model <speaker1>: we want every person to be treated equally with dignity and respect. we want a singapore where everyone belongs and every citizen has a chance to achieve his or her fullest potential. we want a society that values and supports families where we care for and help one another and pitch in to make a difference to our community. model <speaker1>: to our community, these values will shape the government's agenda. we will expand opportunities throughout life for every citizen, regardless of their starting points. we will strengthen social safety nets so that in every stage of life, singaporeans can better cope with uncertainties and look forward with confidence. we will build a smart and livable city, a green, connected and thriving metropolis. model <speaker1>: connected and thriving metropolis that we are all proud to call home. we will deepen singaporeans sense of shared identity and mutual responsibility towards one another. these will be the key priorities for the remainder of this term of government. first, we will expand opportunities throughout life for all, regardless of individual backgrounds and circumstances. meritocracy has long. model <speaker1>: meritocracy has long been the organising principle of our society. it has provided opportunities to countless singaporeans with the drive and ability to excel. but as we prosper as a society, those who have already done well will naturally seek to pass on their advantages to their children. this is why, absent major upheavals, all societies tend to become more stratified and less. model <speaker1>: become more stratified and less socially mobile over time. we will do our utmost to combat this tendency. we must not allow advantages and privileges to become entrenched and persisted over generations. this would weaken and fracture our society. we must ensure a broader and more open meritocracy that works well for all singaporeans. this means rethinking our approach. model <speaker1>: means rethinking our approach to education and work. we will continue to prepare our children for the future starting from their earlier years. we will provide more resources to support those who start out with less. at the same time, we recognize the competitive stresses that have built up in our education system, especially amongst certain segments of society. we will provide everyone. model <speaker1>: we will provide everyone with access to a good education and many chances in life to learn and improve, but let us not be unwittingly drawn into an educational arms race and end up worse off as a society. we must also re-examine how society rewards different skills and talents and recognizes the full range of pathways to success. we should accord greater value to the. model <speaker1>: we should accord greater value to those who are skilled with their hands and contribute through their technical and practical abilities as well as those with the social and empathetic traits to excel in jobs such as caregiving or community service. every singaporean must have the opportunity to take on work they find fulfilling and meaningful, build on their talents, give of their best and be rewarded fairly. model <speaker1>: and be rewarded fairly for it. at the same time, we will step up support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable segments in our society. we will uplift lower-income workers and families and empower them to take the initiative to improve their own lives. we will enhance support for persons with disabilities so they can pursue their aspirations and participate fully as contributing members of society. model <speaker1>: members of society, we will ensure that singapore remains an open and inclusive society where we uplift everyone with opportunities throughout their lives and where we interact with one another as equals regardless of our backgrounds. second, in a world of rapid change, the government will improve social safety nets to help singaporeans better cope with disruptions and setbacks in life. model <speaker1>: disruptions and setbacks in life with more uncertainty in the world economy and faster technological change, workers, especially those in their forties and fifties, are at higher risk of skills obsolescence and unemployment. during the pandemic, we implemented the covid nineteen recovery grant and the s g united jobs and skills program to support those who had lost their jobs. we will study how we should extend. model <speaker1>: we will study how we should extend similar support beyond the pandemic. beyond helping displaced workers, we will further strengthen our skills future ecosystem to bring everyone along on our digitalisation and industry transformation journey. we will enable every citizen to do a significant skills reboot in the course of their working lives. this will help to keep them employable. model <speaker1>: help to keep them employable whether they progress further in their respective fields or transit across to jobs in new areas of growth. we will also strengthen the sense of assurance. in other ways, we will take better care of our growing number of seniors through healthier sg. we are stepping up preventive care and empowering citizens to manage their own health and go for regular screenings and checkups. model <speaker1>: screenings and checkups we will help singaporeans enjoy their golden years with greater peace of mind by enhancing retirement adequacy and expanding care and living options we will enable more seniors to age in place in the comfort of their own homes with their families and friends close by we will also keep public housing affordable and accessible for singaporeans close to one hundred model <speaker1>: close to one hundred thousand private and public homes are expected to be completed between now and twenty twenty five. we are giving priority to young married couples and families with children to purchase their first homes. third, we will press on with longer term efforts to build a city that is green, connected and highly livable. we will continue to renew and transform our urban landscape. model <speaker1>: renew and transform our urban landscape. new centers and districts will be developed outside of the cbd to pilot creative urban solutions that transform the way our people live, work and play. technology will be a key enabler. our urban plans will be integrated with our smart nation vision. our built environment is not just about better hardware and infrastructure. the city should also become more. model <speaker1>: the city should also become more people friendly. we will strengthen the distinctive cultures and heritages of different neighborhoods. we will have better connected streets and green spaces that are conducive for walking and cycling where people can meet, interact and connect with one another. we will make our housing estates more vibrant spaces where children grow up together, where shared memories are formed. model <speaker1>: shared memories are formed and where we nurture our unique identity as a multiracial and multireligious nation. fourth, we will strengthen our collective responsibility to shape our new compact. more government action should not result in a greater sense of dependency and entitlement. instead, the government will through its actions reinforce individual and family efforts. model <speaker1>: and bring forth contributions from other stakeholders. for instance, employers must do their part to invest in their workers. community partners must complement government efforts to support vulnerable families. just as we rally to support one another through the pandemic, those who have done well must pay it forward and give others a hand so that we help one another stand tall. model <speaker1>: help one another stand tall with dignity and pride to tackle the complex challenges ahead. singapore will need a stronger network of stakeholders to participate in nation building, committed businesses that champion socially responsible and sustainable practices, a passionate civil society that advocates for their visions of a better society, an active citizenry that takes ownership of issues. model <speaker1>: that takes ownership of issues. the government will do more to mobilize and involve all stakeholders, in particular our youth, to show our strong interest to take action and initiate change on issues they care about, like mental well-being and sustainability. we will engage the ideas, dynamism and energy of our young singaporeans. ultimately, we will refresh the. model <speaker1>: immediately, our refreshed social compact is about a shared understanding of how we relate to and support one another in our next phase of nationhood. by pooling our individual expertise, experiences and resources, we can achieve better outcomes for ourselves, our fellow citizens and our nation, singapore. even as we focus on our present needs, we must also plan for the future. model <speaker1>: we must also plan for the future and think on behalf of generations to come. we are here today only because of what previous generations of singaporeans did. they were willing to work hard and make sacrifices to give us their children and grandchildren a better life. we must uphold these same values and leave behind a singapore that is better than the one today for the sake of future generations. model <speaker1>: for the sake of future generations, climate change poses an existential threat to our island state. we have committed to decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and are taking resolute steps towards meeting our net zero commitments. we also need to protect ourselves against global warming, especially rising sea levels. we are developing plans for more extensive coastal protection measures. model <speaker1>: coastal protection measures and will dustail these plans with our urban renewal strategies. all this requires responsible use of our fiscal resources and husbanding of our accumulated reserves. we must therefore continue to uphold our longstanding principles of fiscal prudence and discipline so that future generations too will have the means to weather major storms. model <speaker1>: to weather major storms and the wear and tear to build the singapore of their dreams. throughout our nation building journey, we have repeatedly faced challenges and setbacks. we survived when few believed we would. when we started out in nineteen sixty five, the journey looked so daunting with so many problems to solve, but with courage and determination, we made it. model <speaker1>: age and determination, our founding leaders and pioneer generations tackled challenges head on one by one and built this thriving metropolis. we are now in a much stronger position, better poised to overcome our vulnerabilities and armed with crucial resources to push forward with confidence. however, stormy the weather, our collective experiences have strengthened. model <speaker1>: active experiences have strengthened their mutual trust between singaporeans and their confidence in our system of government. this virtual circle relies on us partnering one another and working together to make the impossible possible. the leadership transition to the four g team is well underway. they have worked well together and proven their ability and grit through their handling of the covid nineteen. model <speaker1>: through their handling of the covid nineteen crisis, they have also been engaging citizens widely through the forward singapore exercise. they must continue to strengthen their bonds with singaporeans and work closely with them to write the next chapter of our singapore story. the trust between our political leadership and people and between singaporeans themselves is a key strength. model <speaker1>: it's a key strength we must continue to nurture and cherish. in so many societies, this has gone wrong. these societies face deep divides that are difficult to bridge. instead of bringing people together, political parties aggravate rifts by divisive appeals for support from competing groups. their political systems are stuck in gridlock. consequently, trust in. model <speaker1>: consequently, trust in government and its institutions plummets, making recovery even harder. we cannot afford to let this happen in singapore. in an open, diverse society, people will always have different views. we must debate them honestly and robustly, but our conversations also must be constructive, respectful and responsible, based on facts. model <speaker1>: based on facts and sound analysis, our interactions with one another must be anchored on mutual respect and trust and a shared goal of advancing the larger public interest. in this way, we can work through our differences, enlarge our common ground, and draw strength from our diverse perspectives. so far, i've been. model <speaker1>: so far we have done well out of diversity. we have built a deep reservoir of social capital and trust. as we commemorate the centenary of mister lee kuan yew's birth, we should reflect on the values and principles of the founding generation of leaders. we should reaffirm and uphold our shared values while re-examining what needs to be updated and possessing the. model <speaker1>: and possessing the courage to break new ground only then can we forge ahead confidently firm in our footing and sure of our destination. the covid nineteen experience shows what singaporeans are capable of when we come together as a nation and gives us quiet confidence and strength as we face the future together. let us learn from this. model <speaker1>: let us learn from this experience to work together to improve the lives of today's singaporeans. keep faith with future generations yet unborn and build a singapore that thrives and endures for many years to come. model <speaker1>: you've just been listening to singapore president. model <speaker1>: just been listening to singapore president halimah yacob outlining the government's priorities for the remainder of its term. she was addressing the house after it
