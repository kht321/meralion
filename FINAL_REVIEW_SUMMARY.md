# Final Comprehensive Review - October 26, 2025

## ✅ ALL DOCUMENTATION VERIFIED AND CORRECT

### Comprehensive Review Completed:

I performed a line-by-line review of all documentation to ensure every metric has been updated with the corrected values after the normalization fix.

---

## README.md - ✅ ALL CORRECT

✅ **Model Size Reversal**: "38.8% vs 66.5% WER, a 27.7pp gap"  
✅ **Noise Vulnerability**: "+28.2pp at 10dB SNR", "5.5× amplification"

---

## scripts/final_report.py - ✅ ALL CORRECT (Fixed)

### Abstract (Line 68):
✅ "exceptional robustness (+0.5-0.6pp average degradation...)"  
✅ "superior baseline accuracy (13.6% WER vs Whisper's 17.9%)"

### Table 1 - NSC Robustness (Lines 186-187):
✅ MERaLiON-2-10B: ["13.6%", "3.3%", "+0.6pp", "+5.8pp", "Noise 10dB (19.4%)"]  
✅ MERaLiON-2-3B: ["13.1%", "3.1%", "+0.5pp", "+5.1pp", "Noise 10dB (18.2%)"]

### Table 2 - Conversational (Lines 212-214):
✅ MERaLiON-2-10B: ["66.5%", "-8.5pp", "+0.4pp (Clipping 0.8)", "+52.9pp"]  
✅ MERaLiON-2-3B: ["38.8%", "+2.8pp", "+28.2pp (Noise 10dB)", "+25.7pp"]  
✅ Whisper-small: ["52.2%", "+6.4pp", "+38.5pp (Reverb 0.8)", "+34.3pp"]

### Discussion Paragraph (Lines 219-226):
✅ FIXED: "38.8% WER...66.5%, a 27.7pp gap"  
✅ FIXED: "noise vulnerability amplified 5.5× on conversational audio (+28.2pp at 10dB vs. +5.1pp on NSC)"  
   - Previously incorrectly said "2.4×" and "+12.3pp"

### Conclusion (Lines 422-424):
✅ "exceptional robustness (+0.5-0.6pp average degradation) AND superior baseline accuracy (13.6% vs 17.9% WER)"  
✅ "conversational superiority (38.8% vs. 66.5% WER for 3B vs 10B)"

## docs/Final Report.docx - ✅ REGENERATED CORRECTLY

The Word document has been regenerated with all corrected values from scripts/final_report.py:

### Page 1: Abstract
✅ Contains "+0.5-0.6pp" robustness values  
✅ Contains "13.6% WER vs Whisper's 17.9%" baseline accuracy

### Page 4: Table 1 - NSC Robustness Summary
✅ MERaLiON-2-10B: 13.6% / 3.3% / +0.6pp / +5.8pp  
✅ MERaLiON-2-3B: 13.1% / 3.1% / +0.5pp / +5.1pp

### Page 5: Table 2 - Conversational Results
✅ MERaLiON-2-10B: 66.5% / -8.5pp / +52.9pp  
✅ MERaLiON-2-3B: 38.8% / +2.8pp / +25.7pp  
✅ Whisper-small: 52.2% / +6.4pp / +34.3pp
